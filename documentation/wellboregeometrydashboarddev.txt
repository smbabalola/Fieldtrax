I'll summarize our current work and prepare for the next feature:

**Current Implementation Summary (Trajectory Feature)**
1. Created core components:
   ```
   /src/components/jobs/CreateJob/tabs/TrajectoryTab.jsx
   /src/components/jobs/CreateJob/visualization/TrajectoryVisualizationControls.jsx
   /src/components/jobs/CreateJob/visualization/TrajectoryCalculations.jsx
   /src/components/jobs/CreateJob/modals/TrajectoryDataImportExport.jsx
   ```

2. Added services:
   ```
   /src/services/trajectoryService.js
   /src/services/trajectoryDataService.js
   ```

3. Implemented state management:
   ```
   /src/store/slices/trajectorySlice.js
   /src/store/store.js (updated)
   ```

4. Created utilities:
   ```
   /src/utils/trajectoryValidation.js
   /src/hooks/useTrajectory.js
   ```

**Next Feature: Job Details Modal**
For implementing the job details modal, we'll need to review these potential files:

1. Core Files Needed:
   ```
   /src/components/jobs/JobDetailsModal.jsx (if exists)
   /src/pages/job/JobDetail.jsx or JobDetails.jsx
   /src/services/jobService.js
   /src/store/slices/jobsSlice.js
   ```

2. Related Components:
   ```
   /src/components/jobs/JobsTable.jsx
   /src/pages/job/JobsPage.jsx
   Any existing modal components
   ```

3. Service/API Files:
   ```
   /src/services/api.js
   /src/utils/apiUtils.js
   ```

Before proceeding with implementation, we should:
1. Review existing modal patterns
2. Check current job selection handling
3. Understand existing job data structure
4. Verify API endpoints for job details

Would you like to start a new chat for implementing the job details modal feature? I'll need to review the existing files first to ensure we maintain consistency and don't break existing functionality.
